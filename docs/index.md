## Module 1 Overview 

### Learning Objectives (please fix!)


1. Minimize and account for several sources of error, including systematic errors, in an experiment

2. Use experimental data to determine a physical quantity and its associated uncertainty

3. Communicate procedure and results with a sequence of figures

In Module 2 you will encounter an experiment designed to determine the value of a physical quantity -- in this case, the viscosity of a glycerin solution.  The theory and experiment will be slightly more complex than in Module 1, and you will have the challenge of considering several possible experimental errors that could contribute to your final result.  Once again we will use three phases to frame your analysis activities in Module 2:

1. Exploratory Phase
    - this open-ended phase often involves doing some background reading, getting familiar with a measurement technique, trying to take some preliminary data, coming up with a hypothesis and a plan on how you will test it

2. Dotting-the-i's Phase
    - in this phase you follow the experimental plan you developed in the "Exploratory Phase" to obtain your best values for the physical quantity and uncertainty.

3. Communication Phase
    - after doing your measurements and calculations, you now get to think carefully about how you will communicate your results: What is the best way to visualize your data? What are the deeper conclusions that you can draw from your data? What follow-up experiment would come next? This phase often ends with a scientific paper or presentation. By the end of this course, we are going to build towards a scientific poster presentation.

Although we are going to treat these phases as separate, linear progression, they aren't always like that. Things often don't go as planned when in the dotting-the-i's phase, and you might end up back in the exploratory phase. And you might want to think of how you will communicate your work in the exploratory phase: thinking of the possible conclusions that would result from your experiment can help you decide if your plan for measuring the physical quantity is sensible. These phases are meant to be helpful guideposts for Module 1, and not a set of "rules" for how experimental work always unfolds.

## Weekly Plan

In this module, you will use position vs. time information from metal spheres falling through a glycerin solution to determine the viscosity of the liquid.  The theory behind this module gives you a chance to review and extend your understanding of drag forces from Physics 24.  On the laboratory side, this module is an opportunity to consider the interplay between several sources of error in a final quantity, and to focus on systematic as well as random errors.  We have recorded the raw data for you, in the form of numerous video files.  However, we will walk you through several specific choices we made in setting up the apparatus and recording these videos, and you will answer questions about why those choices were important.  In analyzing the videos, you will make your own choices that can in turn influence the accuracy and precision of your results. 

Module 2 is four weeks long. Each week, you will have a checkpoint due. These checkpoints will give us a chance to provide you feedback as your work towards the Module 2 deliverable: a series of figures with captions that convey the nature of the data and logic, leading to a final result. In this module you should start with Week 1, and the relevant concepts will be linked in context as you go along through this and other weeks.

1. [Week 1 - Exploratory Phase](week1)
    - Checkpoint: preliminary measurement of $$\eta$$ from trajectories of 3.5-mm diameter spheres, with uncertainty from random error in $$v_T$$ values.
2. [Week 2 - Exploratory Phase (continued)](week2)
    - Checkpoint: calculated viscosity as a function of sphere diameter, to check assumptions.
3. Week 3 - Hypothesis Testing Phase
    - Checkpoint: final best values for viscosity and uncertainty
4. Week 4 - Scientific Communication Phase
    - Deliverable: a sequence of figures with captions that communicate your reasoning and results.
