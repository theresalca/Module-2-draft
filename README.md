# Module 1 Webpage Repository

This repository contains the files for the website (https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1). 

The markdown ".md" files in the [/docs/](https://github.com/Physics-50/Module-1/tree/master/docs) folder get converted into the pages shown on the website. If you're new to markdown, [here is a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). Latex can be to the documents by using double dollar signs to enclose the math "$$ .. $$". If you are having problems getting the Latex to be marked down as an inline equation, as a backup trying using "\\( ... \\)" instead.
