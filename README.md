# Module 2 Webpage Repository

This repository was originally copied from the physics-50/Module-1 repository.  Theresa Lynn created this branch for draft work on Module 2 documents and materials.

The original Module 1 repository contains the files for the website (https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1). 

The markdown ".md" files in the [/docs/](https://github.com/theresalca/Module-2/tree/master/docs) folder get converted into the pages shown on the website. If you're new to markdown, [here is a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). Latex can be to the documents by using double dollar signs to enclose the math "$$ .. $$".

You can use a "\<details>" tag to create expandable tabs: 

<details>
<summary markdown='span'> Click to expand </summary>

Take a look a the raw markdown file for how to format the "\<details>" tag. Inside of these tags Latex will not be marked down as an inline equation using the "$$ ... $$" markup, and you should use "\\( ... \\)" instead.
